Modified by Richard Albrecht:
- adapted, using more C++
- locator 'xml_locator' for simple searching/changing the xml document
- code simplified, most of the comments removed, code is self explaning
- class 'rawxml_position' for moving through a vector<char>,
- logger (can be used separately)
- some help methods for strings (can be used separately)
- check of new/delete (code is a small howto overload new/delete example)
- an example, how to use  the parser in your code is in 'main.cpp'
